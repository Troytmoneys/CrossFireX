# CrossFireX

Design documents and prototype notes for a small-team tactical shooter built in Unity.

- [Game Design](docs/game_design.md): Core pillars, adaptive loadouts, maps, social features, and technical implementation notes.

## Web Prototype

A lightweight browser prototype lives in [`web/`](web/) with a Krunker.io-inspired arena, main menu podium, friends list, and inventory mock. Open `web/index.html` in a modern browser to try the demo controls (WASD + mouse aim + click to shoot).
